题目描述 
In Genshin Impact, making wishes is an action trying to obtain some specific character.

In this problem, there are four possible results for making wishes: 
3
3-star weapon, 
4
4-star weapon/character, 
5
5-star non-promotional weapon/character, 
5
5-star promotional weapon/character. Here, we do not distinguish between weapon and character, and we use 
3
3, 
4
4, 
5
5, and 
17
U to represent each result, respectively.

There are some rules for making wishes.

 For every consecutive 
10
10 wishes, it will not only contain 
3
3-star weapons.
 For every consecutive 
90
90 wishes, it must contain at least one 
5
5-star weapon/character, no matter whether it is promotional.
 For every two neighboring 
5
5-star weapons/characters, there must be at least one which is promotional. Here, two 
5
5-star weapons/characters are called neighboring if and only if all wishes between them are not 
5
5-star weapons/characters.

Now you're given a list of wishes. Determine if it fits in the above rules.
